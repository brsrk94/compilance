# 📋 Compliance Predictor System

An AI-powered compliance prediction system that helps companies identify applicable compliances based on their company type.

## 🌟 Features

- **Smart Prediction**: ML-based compliance matching using company type
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, gradient-based design with smooth animations
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find specific compliances
- **Detailed Information**: Complete compliance details including:
  - Obligation ID and Title
  - Description
  - Regulation Name and Type
  - Issuing Authority
  - Jurisdiction Level
  - Mandatory/Optional status
- **Export Functionality**: Download results as CSV
- **Real-time Statistics**: View compliance counts and breakdowns

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will:
- Load data from `mop_updated.xlsx`
- Extract company types from obligation IDs
- Create compliance mappings
- Generate model files (`.pkl` files)

### 3. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📊 How It Works

### Data Structure

The system extracts company types from the `obligation_id` field in the Excel file:
- Format: `MOP-{COMPANY_TYPE}-{NUMBER}`
- Example: `MOP-BIO-001` → Company Type: `BIO`

### Model Training

1. Loads compliance data from Excel
2. Extracts company types using regex pattern matching
3. Creates a mapping: `Company Type → List of Compliances`
4. Saves the mapping and metadata as pickle files

### Prediction

When a user selects a company type:
1. System retrieves all compliances for that type
2. Displays them in an organized, searchable format
3. Shows statistics and breakdowns
4. Allows filtering and export

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Modern purple gradient theme
- **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effect on cards
- **Smooth Animations**: Slide-in effects for compliance cards
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and transitions
- **Color-coded Badges**: Easy identification of compliance types
